ANSWERS


CLONE: pull a copy,

FORK:  fork other people project and clone and push. You can't directly push to others project . You don't have permission

GIT PULL:  git pull all data from remote
GIT FETCH:  git pull only reference doesn't pull actual data. So advantages you can check diff

EG: GIT FETCH ORIGIN MATSER. Form feature branch and 
GIT DIFF you will see difference with out code being pulled from master

GIT REBASE: 

Its is  that  whole features branch comes on top of say dev branch so there is straight one line . Looks nicer clearer. Git merge who feature branch doesn't come . It is better explained with example. rebase It is rewrite history.vit takes tip p=of develop and adds feature. Nice clear linear . It is available at the place of merge asks you when pull request approve than you have the option to merge or rebase


GIT REVERT:   Committed cannot be backed by reset soo revert is used it revert last committed  .  

Git log --oneline to display all commit.

Choose latest 
Git revert commit id

Git push  you will see changes 
It will automatically replace with previous version creates a new commit.

GITHUB PULL REQUEST: do it from Github GUI nicer. Generally you do so reviewer can review . They get red notification can can find out diff and approve. They can merge as well

GIT MERGE: git merge ay feature to dev branch. Push changes of feature branch to dev



GIT BRANCH:  displays all branch.

GIT CHECKOUT BEANCH-NAME:  it changes branch name
GIT BRANCH NEWBRANCH :
git checkout -b anotherbranch:  up both creates new branch

Git log --oneline:  displays all commit reverts in one line.

GIT CHECKOUT COMMIT-CODE: In branch restore local with c=to certain commit. Again to get all commit    GIT CHECKOUT BEANCH-NAME

<<<<<<< HEAD
GIT RESET: 

ALL THESE WORKS BEFORE PUSH

When we unstage, stage and commit . To reset back is called reset . Git reset we can do by iDE ECLIPSE GITHUB DESKTOP AS WELL

GIT RESET --HARD HEAD : it replaces whole code to lates remote head . so all written will be wiped please use it carefully



One add two add three add .  It reset whole 3.  Means there time unsatege. Back
