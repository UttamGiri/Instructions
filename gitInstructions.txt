ANSWERS


CLONE: pull a copy,

FORK:  fork other people project and clone and push. You can't directly push to others project . You don't have permission

GIT PULL:  git pull all data from remote
GIT FETCH:  git pull only reference doesn't pull actual data. So advantages you can check diff

EG: GIT FETCH ORIGIN MATSER. Form feature branch and 
GIT DIFF you will see difference with out code being pulled from master

GIT REBASE: 

Its is  that  whole features branch comes on top of say dev branch so there is straight one line . Looks nicer clearer. Git merge who feature branch doesn't come . It is better explained with example. rebase It is rewrite history.vit takes tip p=of develop and adds feature. Nice clear linear . It is available at the place of merge asks you when pull request approve than you have the option to merge or rebase


GIT REVERT:   Committed cannot be backed by reset soo revert is used it revert last committed  .  It has  **8

GITHUB PULL REQUEST: do it from Github GUI nicer. Generally you do so reviewer can review . They get red notification can can find out diff and approve. They can merge as well

GIT MERGE: git merge ay feature to dev branch. Push changes of feature branch to dev



GIT BRANCH:  displays all branch.

GIT CHECKOUT BEANCH-NAME:  it checkouts branch eg dev branch
GIT BRANCH NEWBRANCH :
git chekout -b anotherbranch:  up both creates new branch

GIT LOG --ONELINE:  displays all commit reverts in one line.

GIT CHECKOUT COMMIT-CODE: In branch restore local with c=to certain commit. Again to get all commit    GIT CHECKOUT BEANCH-NAME

GIT RESET: When we unstage, stage and commit . To reset back is called reset 

GIT RESET --HARD HEAD : it reset to previous head committed . All new written will be wiped out if hasn't been pushed
**

GIT RESET --MEDIUM HEAD:  

GIT RESET --SOFT HEAD

GIT RESET  HEAD~3

 git push --set-upstream origin feature/GitInstrution: for first push after nrbranch created


EDITED directly to master
